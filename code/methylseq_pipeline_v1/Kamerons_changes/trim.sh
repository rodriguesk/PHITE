#TO DO: This script could use testing code that tests each 'then' and 'else' sections of each 'if' statement! So a total of 4 test cases.

#TO DO: halt code with any error to prevent errors from snowballing and not being detected by end user or by development team. http://web.archive.org/web/20110314180918/http://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts.html

#TO DO: #test code: bash trim.sh -r hi -R yo -t dude -T pumpkin
#should output that it is trimming the files. it's looking for the relative path . which exists always. It should trim and output the trimmed files to the current working directory.
